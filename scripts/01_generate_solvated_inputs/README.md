# Generate solvated inputs 
Generate PDB and OpenMM `system.xml` files which contain OpenMM topology, positions, and system for a WT system of interest.

These files are then used as input for running equilibration.

## Python scripts
- generate_solvated_inputs.py - generates the solvated PDB and system.xml.

## Bash scripts
Bash scripts for running `generate_solvated_inputs.py` for each experiment are located in `perses-barnase-barstar-paper/data/`
